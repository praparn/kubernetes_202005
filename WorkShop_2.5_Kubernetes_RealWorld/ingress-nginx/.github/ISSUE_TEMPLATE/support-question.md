Welcome to ingress-nginx!

You probably didn't want to be one this page.  It shouldn't really be here anyway.

* If you want a quick response to a question, ask on the Kubernetes Slack instance in #ingress-nginx.

* If this is actually a bug or a feature request, file one of those.  If you're
  not sure which, just take a guess and we can always re-label.

* If you think this might turn into a bug or feature request, but you're not
  sure, try asking in Slack first.

Still here?  Double-check that this hasn't been asked before, then put your question below
with as many details as possible.

If you need to include code snippets or logs, please put them in fenced code
blocks.  If they're super-long, please use the details tag like
<details><summary>super-long log</summary> lots of stuff </details>
