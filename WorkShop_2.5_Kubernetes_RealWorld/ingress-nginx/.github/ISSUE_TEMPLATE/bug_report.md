## Install minikube/kind

- Minikube https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
- Kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/

## Install the ingress controller

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/static/mandatory.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/static/provider/baremetal/service-nodeport.yaml

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/docs/examples/http-svc.yaml

## Create an ingress (please add any additional annotation required)

echo "
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: foo-bar
  spec:
    rules:
    - host: foo.bar
      http:
        paths:
        - backend:
            serviceName: http-svc
            servicePort: 80
          path: /
" | kubectl apply -f -
